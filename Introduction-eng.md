Introduction:

Hello to all Genshin Impact players around the world! It's a pleasure to meet you here. Amber is one of the first few characters we meet in Tivat, and  she leads us explore this wonderful world. To express our gratitude and love for Amber, we organized this event: **"Amber Online Birthday Party Project"**. 

The plan aims to recruit players who love Amber to create various artworks and Portfolios about Amber, and to display the players' works on Amber's birthday (*8.10*) in 2023. The program welcomes players all over the world to actively participate in this event, hoping to spread Amber's enthusiastic spirit to more travelers.
