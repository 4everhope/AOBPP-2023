Introduction:

Hello to Genshin Impact players around the world! It's a pleasure to meet you here. Amber is one of the first few characters we meet in Tivat, and  she leads us explore this wonderful world. To express our gratitude and love for Amber, we initiate **"Amber Online Birthday Party Project"**. 

The project aims to recruit players who love Amber to create multimedia artworks about Amber. We will display the players' works on Amber's birthday (*8.10*) in 2023. We welcome players all over the world to participate, hoping to spread Amber's enthusiasim to more travelers.
