Introduction:

Hello Genshin Impact players all over the world, it's a pleasure to meet you here. Amber is one of the first few characters we meet, and it is she who leads us to explore this wonderful world. To express our gratitude and love for Amber, we organized this event: **"Amber Online Birthday Party Program"**. The plan aims to recruit players who love Amber to create various forms of art, and to display the players' works on Amber's birthday (*8.10*) in 2023. The program welcomes players from all over the world to actively participate in this event, hoping to pass Amber's love, hope and selfless spirit to more people.
